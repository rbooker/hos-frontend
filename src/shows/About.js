        Once broadcast from a van atop Mount Tabor, House of Sound has been Portland's only truly free-form radio station since 1988.<br/><br />
        We live in an era in which possessing a high-quality copy of nearly any song ever recorded costs essentially nothing. Thus, the primary expense involved with being a music fan is no longer in acquisition, but exploration. Today, you don't have to pay an exorbitant sum for a limited-pressing, import single to get that obscure b-side - but how would you have known it existed in the first place, let alone that it was worth finding? That's what we're here for, and why we deserve your help staying afloat.
